title: Manual Test Cases
---
# Overview

Most of the function tests in Longhorn has been covered by the automation test.

But sometimes it's hard to test certain scenarios in the Automation test, so we have this list of manual testing which should be done before the release.

We're also working on converting the manual tests to the automation test as well.

# Test cases

The `controller` below is referring to the Longhorn Engine working as the controller. It's not the Kubernetes controller in the Longhorn Manager.
