      <description>Test upload  Prepare a large backing image file (make sure the size is greater than 1Gi and the uploading time is longer than 1 minute) in local. Click the backing image creation button in UI, choose Upload From Local, select the file then start upload. Wait for the initialization complete. Then the upload progress will be shown. During the uploading, verify the corresponding backing image data source pod won&amp;rsquo;t use too many CPU (50 ~ 200m) and memory(50 ~ 200Mi) resources.</description>

Test Step Given with Longhorn v1.2.0-rc2 or above. And deploy engine image oldEI older than v1.2.0 (for example: longhornio/longhorn-engine:v1.1.2). And create volume vol-old-engine. And attach volume vol-old-engine to one of a node. And upgrade volume vol-old-engine to engine image oldEI.
When create backup of volume vol-old-engine.
Then watch kubectl kubectl get backups.longhorn.io -l backup-volume=vol-old-engine -w. And should see two backups temporarily (in transition state). And should see only one backup be left after a while.</description>
