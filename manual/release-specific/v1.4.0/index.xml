Test CSI plugin liveness probe should recover CSI socket file Given healthy Longhorn cluster
When delete the Longhorn CSI socket file on one of the node(node-1). rm /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io/csi.sock
Then the longhorn-csi-plugin-* pod on node-1 should be restarted.
And the csi-provisioner-* pod on node-1 should be restarted.
And the csi-resizer-* pod on node-1 should be restarted.
And the csi-snapshotter-* pod on node-1 should be restarted.
And the csi-attacher-* pod on node-1 should be restarted.</description>

Context: since few customers used our broken chart longhorn 100.2.1+up1.3.1 on Rancher (Now fixed) with the workaround. We would like to verify the future upgrade path for those customers.
Steps Set up a cluster of Kubernetes 1.20. Adding this repo to the apps section in new rancher UI repo: https://github.com/PhanLe1010/charts.git branch: release-v2.6-longhorn-1.3.1. Access old rancher UI by navigating to &amp;lt;your-rancher-url&amp;gt;/g. Install Longhorn 1.0.2. Create/attach some volumes. Create a few recurring snapshot/backup job that run every minutes.</description>
