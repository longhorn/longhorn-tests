      <description>Precondition  https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.1/best-practices/#coredns-setup  Case 1:   Create a backup.
  Restore the above backup.
  Power off the volume attached node during the restoring.
  Wait for the Longhorn node down.
  Wait for the restore volume being reattached and starting restoring volume with state Degraded.
  Wait for the restore complete.
 Note: During the restoration process, if the engine process fails to communicate with a replica, all replicas will be marked as ERR, and the volume&amp;rsquo;s RestoreRequired status cannot be set to false.</description>

      <title>Backing Image on a down node</title>

      <description>Update the settings:  Disable Node Soft Anti-affinity. Set Replica Replenishment Wait Interval to a relatively long value.   Create a backing image. Wait for the backing image being ready in the 1st disk. Create 2 volumes with the backing image and attach them on different nodes. Verify:  the disk state map of the backing image contains the disks of all replicas, and the state is running for all disks.</description>

      <title>Node drain and deletion test</title>

      <description>Drain with force Make sure the volumes on the drained/removed node can be detached or recovered correctly. The related issue: https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1214
 Deploy a cluster contains 3 worker nodes N1, N2, N3. Deploy Longhorn. Create a 1-replica deployment with a 3-replica Longhorn volume. The volume is attached to N1. Write some data to the volume and get the md5sum. Force drain and remove N2, which contains one replica only. kubectl drain &amp;lt;Node name&amp;gt; --delete-emptydir-data=true --force=true --grace-period=-1 --ignore-daemonsets=true --timeout=&amp;lt;Desired timeout in secs&amp;gt;  Wait for the volume Degraded.</description>

      <title>Physical node down</title>
      <link>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/pre-release/node-not-ready/node-down/physical-node-down/</link>

      <guid>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/pre-release/node-not-ready/node-down/physical-node-down/</guid>
      <description>One physical node down should result in the state of that node change to Down.
  When using with CSI driver, one node with controller (StatefulSet/Deployment) and pod down should result in Kubernetes migrate the pod to another node, and Longhorn volume should be able to be used on that node as well. Test scenarios for this are documented here.
 Note:
In this case, RWX should be excluded.</description>

      <title>Test node deletion</title>

      <description>Case 1: Delete multiple kinds of nodes:  Deploy Longhorn. Shut down the VM for one node and wait for the node Down. Disable another node. Delete the above 2 nodes. Make sure the corresponding Kubernetes node object is deleted. &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; The related Longhorn node objects will be cleaned up immediately, too. Add new nodes with the same names for the cluster. &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; The new nodes are available.  Case 2: Delete nodes when there are running volumes:  Deploy Longhorn.</description>
