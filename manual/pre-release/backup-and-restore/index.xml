      <description>Prepare 2 k8s clusters: cluster A and cluster B. Install previous version of Longhorn which doesn&amp;rsquo;t include this fix e.g v1.3.1, v1.2.5 on cluster A. Install the release version of Longhorn on cluster B. Set the same backup target on both cluster A and cluster B. Create volume, write some data, and take backup on cluster A. Wait for backup target polling update on cluster B. Make sure the backup created by cluster A can be pulled on cluster B.</description>

Create a volume and write data in the 1st cluster. Then create 1st backup. Restore the backup as a DR volume in the 2nd cluster. Modify the backup poll interval to a large value. Write more data for the volume in the 1st cluster, and create the 2nd backup. Activate the DR volume in the 2nd cluster.</description>
