      <description>Update the settings:  Disable Node Soft Anti-affinity. Set Replica Replenishment Wait Interval to a relatively long value.   Create a backing image. Wait for the backing image being ready in the 1st disk. Create 2 volumes with the backing image and attach them on different nodes. Verify:  the disk state map of the backing image contains the disks of all replicas, and the state is running for all disks.</description>

      <title>Degraded availability with added nodes</title>

      <description>https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1701
Volume creation using UI with degraded availability and added node Start with one node cluster.
 Create a Deployment Pod with a volume and three replicas.  After the volume is attached, scheduling error should be seen from the UI. But no functional impact.   Write data to the Pod. Scale down the deployment to 0 to detach the volume.  scheduling error should be gone.   Scale up the deployment back to 1 verify the data.</description>

      <title>Improve Node Failure Handling By Automatically Force Delete Terminating Pods of StatefulSet/Deployment On Downed Node</title>

      <description>Setup a cluster of 3 worker nodes Install Longhorn and set Default Replica Count = 2 (because we will turn off one node) Create a StatefulSet with 2 pods using the command: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/master/examples/statefulset.yaml  Create a volume + pv + pvc named vol1 and create a deployment(1 pod) of default ubuntu named shell with the usage of pvc vol1 mounted under /mnt/vol1 Find the node which contains one pod of the StatefulSet/Deployment.</description>

      <title>Node disconnection test</title>

      <description>https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1545 For disconnect node : https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/files/4864127/network_down.sh.zip
Case 1:  Disable the setting auto-salvage. Create and attach a volume. Keep writing data to the volume. Disconnect the node that the volume attached to for 100 seconds during the data writing. Wait for the node back. The volume will be detached then reattached automatically. And there are some replicas still running after the reattachment.  Case 2:  Launch Longhorn. Use statefulset launch a pod with the volume and write some data.</description>

      <title>Node drain and deletion test</title>

      <description>Drain with force Make sure the volumes on the drained/removed node can be detached or recovered correctly. The related issue: https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1214
 Deploy a cluster contains 3 worker nodes N1, N2, N3. Deploy Longhorn. Create a 1-replica deployment with a 3-replica Longhorn volume. The volume is attached to N1. Write some data to the volume and get the md5sum. Force drain and remove N2, which contains one replica only. kubectl drain &amp;lt;Node name&amp;gt; --delete-emptydir-data=true --force=true --grace-period=-1 --ignore-daemonsets=true --timeout=&amp;lt;Desired timeout in secs&amp;gt;  Wait for the volume Degraded.</description>

      <title>Physical node down</title>
      <link>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/pre-release/node/physical-node-down/</link>

      <guid>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/pre-release/node/physical-node-down/</guid>
      <description>One physical node down should result in the state of that node change to Down. When using with CSI driver, one node with controller (StatefulSet/Deployment) and pod down should result in Kubernetes migrate the pod to another node, and Longhorn volume should be able to be used on that node as well. Test scenarios for this are documented here. Reboot the node that the controller attached to. After reboot complete, the volume should be reattached to the node.</description>

      <title>Test kubelet restart on a node of the cluster</title>

      <description>Related issues: https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2629
Case 1: Kubelet restart on RKE1 multi node cluster:  Create a RKE1 cluster with config of 1 etcd/control plane and 3 worker nodes. Deploy Longhorn on the cluster. Deploy prometheus monitoring app on the cluster which is using Longhorn storage class or deploy a statefulSet with Longhorn volume. Write some data into the mount point and compute the md5sum. Restart the kubelet on the node where the statefulSet or Prometheus pod is running using the command sudo docker restart kubelet Observe the volume.</description>

      <description>Case 1: Delete multiple kinds of nodes:  Deploy Longhorn. Shut down the VM for one node and wait for the node Down. Disable another node. Delete the above 2 nodes. Make sure the corresponding Kubernetes node object is deleted. &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; The related Longhorn node objects will be cleaned up immediately, too. Add new nodes with the same names for the cluster. &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; The new nodes are available.  Case 2: Delete nodes when there are running volumes:  Deploy Longhorn.</description>
