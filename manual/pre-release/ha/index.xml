      <description>Backing image with an invalid URL schema Create a backing image via a invalid download URL. e.g., httpsinvalid://longhorn-backing-image.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/parrot.qcow2, https://longhorn-backing-image.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.invalid.com/parrot.raw. Wait for the download start. The backing image data source pod, which is used to download the file from the URL, should become Failed then be cleaned up immediately. The corresponding and only entry in the disk file status should be failed. The error message in this entry should explain why the downloading or the pod becomes failed.</description>

      <description>Some Longhorn worker nodes in AWS Auto Scaling group is in replacement Launch a Kubernetes cluster with the nodes in AWS Auto Scaling group. Make sure there is an additional EBS attached to instance with setting Delete on Termination disabled. Deploy Longhorn v1.1.0 on the cluster and Set ReplicaReplenishmentWaitInterval. Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s longer than the time needs for node replacement. Deploy some workloads using Longhorn volumes. Trigger the ASG instance refresh in AWS.</description>

      <description>Create a migratable volume:
Deploy a migratable StorageClass. e.g., https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/examples/rwx/storageclass-migratable.yaml Create a PVC with access mode ReadWriteMany via this StorageClass. Attach a volume to a node and wait for volume running. Then write some data into the volume. Here I would recommend directly restoring a volume (set fromBackup in the StorageClass) and attach it instead.
Start the migration by request attaching to another node for the volume.
Trigger the following scenarios then confirm or rollback the migration:</description>

      <description>Create and attach a volume. Write a large amount of data to the volume. Disable disk scheduling and the node scheduling for one replica. Crash the replica progress. Verify the corresponding replica will become ERROR. the volume will keep robustness Degraded. Enable the disk scheduling. Verify nothing changes. Enable the node scheduling. Verify. the failed replica is reused by Longhorn. the rebuilding progress in UI page looks good. the data content is correct after rebuilding.</description>
