      <description>Set up a node with CentOS and make sure that the output of sestatus indicates that SELinux is enabled and set to Enforcing. Run the k3s installation script. Install Longhorn. The system should come up successfully. The logs of the Engine Image pod should only say installed, and the system should be able to deploy a Volume successfully from the UI.  Note: There appears to be some problems with running k3s on CentOS, presumably due to the firewalld rules.</description>
