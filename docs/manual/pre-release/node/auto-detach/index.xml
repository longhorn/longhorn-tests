      <description>Volume Attachment Recovery Policy : Immediate:
 Have a workload deployed using longhorn volume change the terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 480 in the yaml of the workload. Power down the node where the pod is attached on The replacement pod is created after 5 minutes from when the original pod goes into Unknown state. And this replacement pod is in &amp;ldquo;creating/pending&amp;rdquo; state the volume is able to attach/mount and workload come up in about 30 seconds data is accessible after the pod comes up active  Volume Attachment Recovery Policy: wait:</description>

      <description>Volume Attachment Recovery Policy: Immediate:
 Have a stateful set workload deployed using volume claim template using longhorn storage class. Number of pods - 6 2 pods are scheduled on N1. Power off N1. The pods go into Unknown state. replacement pods are NOT created force delete these pods in &amp;ldquo;Unknown&amp;rdquo; state replacement pods are created first pod comes up in about 30 seconds. data is accessible in the volume. It takes another 1 minute approx for the second pod to come up.</description>
