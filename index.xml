      <description>This one is a special case, were the volume only contains 1 backup, which the user requests to delete while the user has another backup in progress. Previously the in progress backup would only be written to disk after it&amp;rsquo;s completed while the delete request would trigger the GC which then detects that there is no backups left on the volume which would trigger the volume deletion.
 create vol dak and attach to the same node vol bak is attached connect to node via ssh and issue dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/longhorn/dak status=progress wait for a bunch of data to be written (1GB) take a backup(1) wait for a bunch of data to be written (1GB) take a backup(2) immediately request deletion of backup(1) verify that backup(2) completes succesfully verify that backup(1) has been deleted verify that all blocks mentioned in the backup(2).</description>

      <description> Create a backup. Create a restore volume from the backup. Power off the volume attached node during the restoring. Wait for the Longhorn node down. Wait for the restore volume being reattached and starting restoring volume with state Degraded. Wait for the restore complete. Attach the volume and verify the restored data. Verify the volume works fine.  </description>

      <description>Scenario 1  Create a pod with Longhorn volume. Write data to the volume and get the md5sum. Create the 1st backup for the volume. Create a DR volume from the backup. Wait for the DR volume starting the initial restore. Then power off/reboot the DR volume attached node immediately. Wait for the DR volume detached then reattached. Wait for the DR volume restore complete after the reattachment. Activate the DR volume and check the data md5sum.</description>

      <description>Set up a node with CentOS and make sure that the output of sestatus indicates that SELinux is enabled and set to Enforcing. Run the k3s installation script. Install Longhorn. The system should come up successfully. The logs of the Engine Image pod should only say installed, and the system should be able to deploy a Volume successfully from the UI.  Note: There appears to be some problems with running k3s on CentOS, presumably due to the firewalld rules.</description>

      <description>DR volume keeps getting the latest update from the related backups. Edge cases where the latest backup is deleted can be test as below.
Case 1:  Create a volume and take multiple backups for the same. Delete the latest backup. Create another cluster and set the same backup store to access the backups created in step 1. Go to backup page and click on the backup. Verify the Create Disaster Recovery option is enabled for it.</description>

      <description>Setup  2 attached volumes with data. 2 detached volumes with data. 2 new volumes without data. 2 deployments of one pod. 1 statefulset of 10 pods. Auto Salvage set to disable.  Test After upgrade:
 Make sure the existing instance managers didn&amp;rsquo;t restart. Make sure pods didn&amp;rsquo;t restart. Check the contents of the volumes. If the Engine API version is incompatible, manager cannot do anything about the attached volumes except detaching it.</description>

      <description>Make sure that the default Longhorn setup has all nodes with /var/lib/rancher/longhorn/ as the default Longhorn disk under the Node page. Additionally, check the Setting page and make sure that the &amp;ldquo;Default Data Path&amp;rdquo; setting has been set to /var/lib/rancher/longhorn/ by default. Now, change the &amp;ldquo;Default Data Path&amp;rdquo; setting to something else, such as /home, and save the new settings. Add a new node to the cluster with the proper dependencies to run Longhorn.</description>

      <title>NFSv4 Enforcement (No NFSv3 Fallback)</title>
      <link>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/release-specific/v1.0.1/nfsv4-enforcement/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/release-specific/v1.0.1/nfsv4-enforcement/</guid>
      <description>Since the client falling back to NFSv3 usually results in a failure to mount the NFS share, the way we can check for NFSv3 fallback is to check the error message returned and see if it mentions rpc.statd, since dependencies on rpc.statd and other services are no longer needed for NFSv4, but are needed for NFSv3. The NFS mount should not fall back to NFSv3 and instead only give the user a warning that the server may be NFSv3:</description>

      <description>https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1545
Case 1:  Disable the setting auto-salvage. Create and attach a volume. Keep writing data to the volume. Disconnect the node that the volume attached to for 100 seconds during the data writing. Wait for the node back. The volume will be detached then reattached automatically. And there are some replicas still running after the reattachment.  Case 2:  Launch Longhorn. Launch a pod with the volume and write some data.</description>

 Deploy a cluster contains 3 worker nodes N1, N2, N3. Deploy Longhorn. Create a 1-replica deployment with a 3-replica Longhorn volume. The volume is attached to N1. Write some data to the volume and get the md5sum. Force drain and remove N2, which contains one replica only. Wait for the volume Degraded.</description>

      <description>One physical node down should result in the state of that node change to Down When using with CSI driver, one node with controller and pod down should result in Kubernetes migrate the pod to another node, and Longhorn volume should be able to be used on that node as well. Test scenarios for this are documented here Reboot the node that the controller attached to. After reboot complete, the volume should be reattached to the node.</description>

      <description>There are three different cases we need to test when the user inputs a default setting for Priority Class:
 Install Longhorn with no priority-class set in the default settings. The Priority Class setting should be empty after the installation completes according to the longhorn-ui, and the default Priority of all Pods in the longhorn-system namespace should be 0:  ~ kubectl -n longhorn-system describe pods | grep Priority # should be repeated many times Priority: 0 Install Longhorn with a nonexistent priority-class in the default settings.</description>

 Create a volume of size 1GB, say terminate-immediatly volume. Create PV/PVC from the volume terminate-immediatly Create a deployment of 1 pod with image ubuntu:xenial and the PVC terminate-immediatly in default namespace Find the node on which the pod is scheduled to. Let&amp;rsquo;s say the node is Node-1 ssh into Node-1 destroy the filesystem of terminate-immediatly by running command dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/longhorn/terminate-immediatly Find and kill the engine instance manager in Node-X.</description>

      <description>Create a new instance on Linode and setup an Http Proxy server on the instance as in this instruction (you will have to log in to see the instruction) Create a cluster using Rancher as below:  Choose AWS EC2 t2.medium as the node template. The reason to chose EC2 is that its security group makes our lives easier to block the outgoing traffic from the instance and all k8s Pods running inside the instance.</description>

      <description>A number of cases need to be manually tested in longhorn-ui. To test these cases, create the Volume with the specified conditions in each case, and then try to delete it. What is observed should match what is described in the test case:
 A regular Volume. Only the default deletion prompt should show up asking to confirm deletion. A Volume with a Persistent Volume. The deletion prompt should tell the user that there is a Persistent Volume that will be deleted along with the Volume.</description>

      <description>Volume Attachment Recovery Policy : Immediate:
 Have a workload deployed using longhorn volume change the terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 480 in the yaml of the workload. Power down the node where the pod is attached on The replacement pod is created after 5 minutes from when the original pod goes into Unknown state. And this replacement pod is in &amp;ldquo;creating/pending&amp;rdquo; state the volume is able to attach/mount and workload come up in about 30 seconds data is accessible after the pod comes up active  Volume Attachment Recovery Policy: wait:</description>

      <description>Volume Attachment Recovery Policy: Immediate:
 Have a stateful set workload deployed using volume claim template using longhorn storage class. Number of pods - 6 2 pods are scheduled on N1. Power off N1. The pods go into Unknown state. replacement pods are NOT created force delete these pods in &amp;ldquo;Unknown&amp;rdquo; state replacement pods are created first pod comes up in about 30 seconds. data is accessible in the volume. It takes another 1 minute approx for the second pod to come up.</description>
