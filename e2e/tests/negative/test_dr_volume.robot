    ...                Create a pod with Longhorn volume.
    ...                Write data to the volume and get the md5sum.
    ...                Create the 1st backup for the volume.
    ...                Create a DR volume from the backup.
    ...                Wait for the DR volume starting the initial restore.
    ...                Then reboot the DR volume attached node immediately.
    ...                Wait for the DR volume detached then reattached.
    ...                Wait for the DR volume restore complete after the reattachment.
    ...                Activate the DR volume and check the data md5sum.
    Given Create volume 0 with    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Write data 0 to volume 0
    Then Volume 0 backup 0 should be able to create

        When Activate DR volume 1
        And Attach volume 1
        And Wait for volume 1 healthy
        Then Check volume 1 data is backup 0 of volume 0
        Then Detach volume 1

    ...                1. Launch 2 clusters and both have Longhorn installed
    ...                2. Set up a backup target.
    ...                3. Create a volume and write data in the 1st cluster. Then create 1st backup.
    ...                4. Restore the backup as a DR volume in the 2nd cluster.
    ...                5. Modify the backup poll interval to a large value.
    ...                6. Write more data for the volume in the 1st cluster, and create the 2nd backup.
    ...                7. Activate the DR volume in the 2nd cluster. Then verify the data
    ...                8. The activated DR volume should contain the latest data.
    Given Create dummy backup from backup-1.tar.gz
