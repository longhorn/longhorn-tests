*** Test Cases ***
Restart Volume Node Kubelet While Workload Heavy Writing
    Given Set setting rwx-volume-fast-failover to ${RWX_VOLUME_FAST_FAILOVER}
    And Create storageclass longhorn-test with    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Create statefulset 0 using RWO volume with longhorn-test storageclass
    And Create statefulset 1 using RWX volume with longhorn-test storageclass

    FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${LOOP_COUNT}
        And Keep writing data to pod of statefulset 0
        And Keep writing data to pod of statefulset 1

        When Stop volume nodes kubelet for 10 seconds    statefulset 0    statefulset 1
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 0 healthy
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 1 healthy
        And Wait for workloads pods stable    statefulset 0    statefulset 1

        Then Check statefulset 0 works
        And Check statefulset 1 works

Stop Volume Node Kubelet For More Than Pod Eviction Timeout While Workload Heavy Writing
    Given Set setting rwx-volume-fast-failover to ${RWX_VOLUME_FAST_FAILOVER}
    And Create storageclass longhorn-test with    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Create statefulset 0 using RWO volume with longhorn-test storageclass
    And Create statefulset 1 using RWX volume with longhorn-test storageclass

    FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${LOOP_COUNT}
        And Keep writing data to pod of statefulset 0
        And Keep writing data to pod of statefulset 1

        When Stop volume nodes kubelet for 360 seconds    statefulset 0    statefulset 1
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 0 healthy
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 1 healthy
        And Wait for workloads pods stable    statefulset 0    statefulset 1

        Then Check statefulset 0 works
