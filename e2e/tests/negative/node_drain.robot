Stopped Replicas On Deleted Nodes Should Not Be Counted As Healthy Replicas When Draining Nodes
    [Documentation]    Stopped replicas on deleted nodes should not be counted as healthy replicas when draining nodes
    ...    When draining a node, the node will be set as unscheduled and all pods should be evicted.
    ...    By Longhornâ€™s default settings, the replica will only be evicted if there is another healthy replica on the running node.

    ...    And Stop Node_1 that contains one of the replicas.
    ...    And Drain Node_2 so that all pods on Node_2 are evicted, but the replica instance manager pod is still on Node_2 because it is protected by PDB.
