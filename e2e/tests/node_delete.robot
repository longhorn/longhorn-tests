Delete Volume Node While Replica Rebuilding
    Given Set setting node-down-pod-deletion-policy to do-nothing
    And Create persistentvolumeclaim 0 using RWO volume
    And Create deployment 0 with persistentvolumeclaim 0
    And Write 2048 MB data to file data in deployment 0

    FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${LOOP_COUNT}
        When Delete replica of deployment 0 volume on volume node
        And Wait until volume of deployment 0 replica rebuidling started on volume node
        And Delete volume of deployment 0 volume node

        Then Wait for volume of deployment 0 attached and unknown
        And Add deleted node back
        And Wait for volume of deployment 0 attached and healthy
        And Wait for deployment 0 pods stable
        And Check deployment 0 data in file data is intact
