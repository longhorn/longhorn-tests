Test Invalid Volume Name
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test invalid volume name
    [Template]    Create volume with invalid name should fail
        wrong_volume-name-1.0

Test Volume Basic
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test basic volume operations
    ...
    ...                1. Create a volume and attach to the current node, then check volume states
    ...                2. Write then read back to check volume data
    Given Create volume 0 with    size=2Gi    numberOfReplicas=3    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    When Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy

    When Write data to volume 0
    Then Check volume 0 data is intact

    And Detach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 detached
    And Delete volume 0

Test Snapshot
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test snapshot operations
    Given Create volume 0 with    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    When Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy

    And Create snapshot 0 of volume 0

    And Write data 1 to volume 0
    And Create snapshot 1 of volume 0

    And Write data 2 to volume 0
    And Create snapshot 2 of volume 0

    Then Validate snapshot 0 is parent of snapshot 1 in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 1 is parent of snapshot 2 in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 2 is parent of volume-head in volume 0 snapshot list

    When Delete snapshot 2 of volume 0
    Then Validate snapshot 2 is in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 2 is marked as removed in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Check volume 0 data is data 2

    When Detach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 detached
    And Attach volume 0 in maintenance mode
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy

    And Revert volume 0 to snapshot 1
    And Detach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 detached
    And Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    Then Check volume 0 data is data 1
    And Validate snapshot 1 is parent of volume-head in volume 0 snapshot list

    When Delete snapshot 1 of volume 0
    And Delete snapshot 0 of volume 0

    And Purge volume 0 snapshot
    Then Validate snapshot 0 is not in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 1 is in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 1 is marked as removed in volume 0 snapshot list
    And Validate snapshot 2 is not in volume 0 snapshot list

    And Check volume 0 data is data 1

Test Strict Local Volume Disabled Revision Counter By Default
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]
    ...    1. Set the global setting disable-revision-counter to false
    ...    2. Create a volume with 1 replica and strict-local data locality
    ...    3. See that the revisionCounterDisabled: true for volume/engine/replica CRs
    Given Set setting disable-revision-counter to false
    When Create volume 0 with    numberOfReplicas=1    dataLocality=strict-local
    And Wait for volume 0 detached
    Then Volume 0 setting revisionCounterDisabled should be True
    And Volume 0 engine revisionCounterDisabled should be True
    And Volume 0 replica revisionCounterDisabled should be True

Replica Rebuilding
    [Documentation]    -- Manual test plan --
    ...                1. Create and attach a volume.
    ...                2. Write a large amount of data to the volume.
    ...                3. Disable disk scheduling and the node scheduling for one replica.
    ...                4. Crash the replica progress. Verify
    ...                    - the corresponding replica in not running state.
    ...                    - the volume will keep robustness Degraded.
    ...                5. Enable the disk scheduling. Verify nothing changes.
    ...                6. Enable the node scheduling. Verify.
    ...                    - the failed replica is reused by Longhorn.
    ...                    - the data content is correct after rebuilding.
    ...                    - volume r/w works fine.
    ...
    ...                == Not implemented ==
    ...                7. Direct delete one replica via UI. Verify
    ...                - a new replica will be replenished immediately.
    ...                - the rebuilding progress in UI page looks good.
    ...                - the data content is correct after rebuilding.
    ...                - volume r/w works fine.
    When Create volume 0 with    size=10Gi    numberOfReplicas=3    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Attach volume 0 to node 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy

    And Write 1 GB data to volume 0

    And Disable node 1 scheduling
    And Disable node 1 default disk

    And Crash volume 0 replica process on node 1
    Then Wait volume 0 replica on node 1 stopped
    And Wait for volume 0 degraded

    And Enable node 1 default disk
    Then Check volume 0 replica on node 1 kept in stopped
    And Check for volume 0 kept in degraded

    And Enable node 1 scheduling
    Then Wait until volume 0 replica rebuilding started on node 1
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Check volume 0 crashed replica reused on node 1

    And Check volume 0 data is intact
    And Check volume 0 works
