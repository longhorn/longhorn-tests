Disrupt Data Plane Traffic For Less Than Long Engine Replica Timeout
    Given Set setting engine-replica-timeout to 15
    And Set setting auto-salvage to false
    And Create storageclass longhorn-test with    dataEngine=v1
    And Create statefulset 0 using RWO volume with longhorn-test storageclass
    FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${LOOP_COUNT}
        And Drop instance-manager egress traffic of statefulset 0 for 25 seconds without waiting for completion
        Then Write 1024 MB data to file data in statefulset 0
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 0 attached and degraded
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 0 healthy
        And Check statefulset 0 data in file data is intact

Don't Orphan Processes When Node Not Ready
    [Tags]    robot:skip
    [Documentation]    Don't orphan processes when a node becomes not ready.
    ...
    ...                1. Create a volume of any size and a number of replicas equal to the number of nodes.
    ...                2. Attach the volume to a node.
    ...                3. Stop kubelet on the attached node long enough the node to become not ready and its instance
    ...                   manager to have state unknown.
    ...                   NOTE: The timing is important here. The instance manager reaches state unknown after
    ...                   approximately 30 seconds. Approximately 6 minutes later, Kubernetes evicts most pods on the
    ...                   node, including the instance manager pod, so the instance manager transitions to state error.
    ...                   The remaining steps must be executed before this happens.
    ...                4. Detach the volume.
    ...                5. Verify that no instance-manager CR has a status.instanceEngines[<volume-name-e-...>].
    ...                6. Verify that no instance-manager CR has a status.instanceReplicas[<volume-name-r-...>].
