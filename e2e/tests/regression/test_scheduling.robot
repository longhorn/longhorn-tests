Test Soft Anti Affinity Scheduling
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test that volumes with Soft Anti-Affinity work as expected.
    ...
    ...    With Soft Anti-Affinity, a new replica should still be scheduled on a node
    ...    with an existing replica, which will result in "Healthy" state but limited
    ...    redundancy.
    ...
    ...    1. Create a volume and attach to the current node
    ...    2. Generate and write `data` to the volume.
    ...    3. Set `soft anti-affinity` to true
    ...    4. Disable current node's scheduling.
    ...    5. Remove the replica on the current node
    ...    6. Wait for the volume to complete rebuild. Volume should have 3 replicas.
    ...    7. Verify `data`
    Given Create volume 0 with    numberOfReplicas=3    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Write data to volume 0

    When Setting replica-soft-anti-affinity is set to true
    # disabling scheduling on a node only sets the node status to "Disable", not "Unschedulable"
    # therefore disabling scheduling doesn't alter the node["conditions"]["Schedulable"]["status"] field
    # only cordoning a node can set it to "Unschedulable"
    And Cordon node 1
    And Delete volume 0 replica on node 1

    Then Wait until volume 0 replicas rebuilding completed
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Check volume 0 data is intact

Test Replica Auto Balance Disk In Pressure
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test replica auto balance disk in pressure
    ...    This test simulates a scenario where a disk reaches a certain
    ...    pressure threshold (80%), triggering the replica auto balance
    ...    to rebuild the replicas to another disk with enough available
