Test Encrypted Volume Basic
    [Arguments]    ${volume_type}
    [Documentation]    Test basic encrypted volume operations for both RWO and RWX volumes
    ...                Arguments:
    ...                - ${volume_type}: Volume access mode (RWO or RWX)
    Given Create crypto secret
    When Create storageclass longhorn-crypto with    encrypted=true    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Create persistentvolumeclaim 0    volume_type=${volume_type}    sc_name=longhorn-crypto
    And Create deployment 0 with persistentvolumeclaim 0
    And Wait for volume of deployment 0 healthy
    And Write 100 MB data to file data.txt in deployment 0
    Then Check deployment 0 data in file data.txt is intact

    When Scale down deployment 0 to detach volume
    And Scale up deployment 0 to attach volume
    And Wait for volume of deployment 0 healthy
    And Wait for workloads pods stable    deployment 0
    Then Check deployment 0 data in file data.txt is intact

    And Write 10 MB data to file data.txt in deployment 0
    Then Check deployment 0 data in file data.txt is intact

    When Expand deployment 0 volume to 100 MiB
    Then Wait for deployment 0 volume size expanded
    And Check deployment 0 pods did not restart
    # Verify the actual disk size in the sharemanager pod.
    # NOTE: For encrypted volumes, 16MiB is reserved for the encryption header.
    # Therefore, a 100MiB requested volume will result in an 84MiB actual disk size.
    And Assert disk size in instance manager pod for deployment 0 is 84MiB
    When Scale down deployment 0 to detach volume
    And Scale up deployment 0 to attach volume
    And Wait for volume of deployment 0 healthy
    And Wait for workloads pods stable    deployment 0
    Then Check deployment 0 data in file data.txt is intact
