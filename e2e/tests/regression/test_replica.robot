Test Replica Rebuilding Per Volume Limit
    [Tags]    coretest
    [Documentation]    Test the volume always only have one replica scheduled for rebuild
    ...
    ...    1. Set soft anti-affinity to `true`.
    ...    2. Create a volume with 1 replica.
    ...    3. Attach the volume and write a few hundreds MB data to it.
    ...    4. Scale the volume replica to 5.
    ...    5. Monitor the volume replica list to make sure there should be only 1 replica in WO state.
    ...    6. Wait for the volume to complete rebuilding. Then remove 4 of the 5 replicas.
    ...    7. Monitoring the volume replica list again.
    ...    8. Once the rebuild was completed again, verify the data checksum.
    Given Set setting replica-soft-anti-affinity to true
    And Create volume 0 with    numberOfReplicas=3    dataEngine=${DATA_ENGINE}
    And Attach volume 0
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Write data to volume 0

    When Update volume 0 replica count to 5
    Then Only one replica rebuilding will start at a time for volume 0
    And Monitor only one replica rebuilding will start at a time for volume 0
    And Wait until volume 0 replicas rebuilding completed

    When Delete 4 replicas of volume 0
    Then Only one replica rebuilding will start at a time for volume 0
    And Monitor only one replica rebuilding will start at a time for volume 0
    And Wait until volume 0 replicas rebuilding completed
    And Wait for volume 0 healthy
    And Check volume 0 data is intact
