Disconnect Volume Node Network While Workload Heavy Writing
    Given Create statefulset 0 using RWO volume
    FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${LOOP_COUNT}
        And Keep writing data to pod of statefulset 0
        When Disconnect volume node network of statefulset 0 for 10 seconds
        And Wait for volume of statefulset 0 healthy
        And Wait for statefulset 0 pods stable
        Then Check statefulset 0 works
